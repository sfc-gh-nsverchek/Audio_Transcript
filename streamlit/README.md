Few things here.

this is spreading like wildfire and i think someone who is really good with either CSS or turning this into react native app should polish this a bit to make it more than a blank screen
This app will return more audio files than what is actually reported in the text results. Cortex Search is a fuzzy search so sort of like google it will return everything but you result will be in there somewhere
I hope someone will update the app to only return results where a ranking is at a certain level. Ranking is a new feature that you have to get enabled in your account
I am not sure how this will scale to thousands / hundreds of thousands of calls. I have trouble getting Cortex people to answer this.
Here are the installed packages.
