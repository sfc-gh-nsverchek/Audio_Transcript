For the notebook you can ignore the PDF section. I removed this capabilty from the quickstart here 
https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/ai_agent_health_payers_cc/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0

Go into the SQL folder first and set up the first half of the document for the External integration in order to install libs in the notebook

Also for the notebook, ignore the one cell that processed mp3s using whisper for only 30 seconds. I updated the code to process for longer. There might be an easier way to do it with a whisper flag.  Please let me know of improvements. 

Additionally, i think this whole thing can be simplified and we might not even need this notebook with the new AI TRANSRCIBE feature. someone please update it with the new features !
